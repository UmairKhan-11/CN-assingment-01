## Q4. Identify the status code in the first server response.
The first response from the server contains the status code:
**200 OK**

---

## Q5. How many HTTP response messages are exchanged in total?
By filtering with `http.response` in Wireshark, we observe multiple response messages.  
- First response: `200 OK (text/html)` 
- Second response: `200 OK (application/javascript)` 
- Third response: `200 OK (text/css)`
- Fourth response: `200 OK (text/css)`
- (Additional responses may appear for other resources like images or scripts)  

**Total responses observed: 4 (minimum in this trace).**

---

## Q6. Determine whether the connection is persistent or not.
The connection is **persistent**, because:
- The request includes the header `Connection: keep-alive`.  
- Multiple HTTP responses (HTML + CSS) were exchanged over the same TCP connection without reconnecting.  

**Conclusion:** The HTTP connection is peristent.
